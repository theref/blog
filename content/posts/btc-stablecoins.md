When I see 0.004 BTC I have no idea what we’re talking about; a house, a car, or a coffee. 5 USDC makes complete sense to me.

Stablecoins like USDC, USDT, are winning payments right now, and I hate it. They're centralised, opaque, and attached to currencies that we'd all previously agreed were failing.
And it's not because they're in any way "better money" - they're not. It's because they're easier to think in.



2) Admit the uncomfortable truth (one paragraph)

Prompt sentences you write:

“Stablecoins are winning payments right now, and I hate it.”

“Not because they’re ‘better money’ — because they’re easier to think in.”

3) Name the actual problem: unit-of-account + mental model

Prompts:

“People don’t buy things in ETH. They buy things in rent/groceries/cars.”

“If your currency requires constant conversion, it loses day-to-day.”

4) Why this matters (the warning)

This is your “thought leader” moment: consequences.
Prompts:

“If stablecoins become the default unit, crypto becomes rails for fiat.”

“That’s not the future I want.”

“We’ll keep the UX and lose the sovereignty.”

5) What we should do (the fix list)

This is where your “dual quote + education + sats” goes.

Builder recommendations (bullets):

Dual-quote every price (stable + BTC/ETH) at checkout.

Default display in the user’s chosen “mental unit” (USD/EUR/GBP/sats).

Let users switch to sats/gwei and make it sticky.

Show conversion transparently (“$5 ≈ 742 sats”) and repeat it everywhere.

Prefer sats over BTC decimals in consumer contexts (normalize integers).

6) One paragraph addressing the obvious objection

You want this to stay pro-BTC/ETH but not naive.

Pick one objection and respond:

“People will never price in BTC because volatility.”

“Sats won’t catch on; too nerdy.”

“Dual pricing will confuse users.”

7) Close (call to action)

Prompts:

“If you’re building wallets/apps, this is on you.”

“Stop making users do math.”

“Make BTC/ETH feel like money.”

The steelman (now it fits your stance)

You don’t need “stablecoins inherit fiat censorship” as the steelman. That’s a separate point you can mention briefly, but your real steelman is:

“Stablecoins win because volatility makes pricing in BTC/ETH impractical.”

Then your response is: fine — but we can still win the unit/education battle (sats + dual quote) and stop outsourcing everyday pricing to fiat forever.

Next step (you write, I review)

Write sections 1–4 only (hook → uncomfortable truth → problem → why it matters). Paste that, and I’ll do a line-edit as a PR review: cut bloat, sharpen claims, keep your voice.

- what is a stablecoin compare to btc, eth
- btc, eth price/value is determined by market forces, buyers + sellers
- stablecoins are either pegged via collateral or algorithmically to fiat
- 0.004 BTC makes no sense to me and i work in this field
- 5 USDC makes complete sense
- this is a UX problem
- do we double quote?
- do we force users to convert?
- is satoshis/gwei better? (i personally don't like thinking in 0.0000 BTC)
- at the end of the day, 99% of real world spending is in fiat and thats the number people want to see 'go up'. they want to buy a new car/house/groceries etc
