When I see 0.004 BTC, I have no idea if we’re talking about a house, a car, or a coffee. 5 USDC makes complete sense to me.

Stablecoins like USDC, USDT are winning payments right now, and I hate it. They're centralised, enforce opaque rules, and attached to currencies that many of us know are failing.
The irony is that a lot of stablecoin reserves end up in US Treasuries and therefore these 'crypto dollars' are actually reinforcing the existing fiat system.
And it's not because they're in any way "better money" - they're not. It's because they're easier to think in.

People don't think in terms of ETH or BTC. They think in £3 coffees and £100 grocery shops. Whenever we start talking about Bitcoin, you end up doing mental conversions. Add in some volatility and it becomes impossible to create muscle memory for doing those conversions intuitively.

I am worried that crypto is merely becoming rails for fiat. We seem to be sacrificing Sovereignty for convenience.

**What do we do instead?**
- Dual quote prices anywhere commerce happens (fiat + BTC/ETH)
- Prefer integers: sats over decimals
- Let users pin a default
- Show conversion explicitly (“£3 ≈ 5,200 sats @ 14:32”)
- 
I understand that no one wants their rent priced in a volatile asset. And in most tax regimes, spending crypto is a disposal and can cause a mountain of admin. That's why dual quoting matters. It normalises BTC/ETH units without forcing people to denominate their lives in an asset that fluctuates hourly.
So, if you're a wallet developer, stop making users do maths. Just dual quote in meaningful integers and make it the default.
