Hi, I'm James. I build [Threshold Cryptography](https://taco.build) tools and protocols.

I care about privacy, governance, and autonomy: giving people and communities the ability to rely less on centralized authorities and concentrated power.

I'm trying to get better at building things that directly impact the world, rather than just nice ideas.

Here you'll find [essays and tutorials](/posts), and links to [talks](/talks) I've given.

My bias: I think most people are good, and I'm optimistic about the future. I worry about the small percentage of people who crave power. The things they do with that power. And the systems that enable their behaviour.

Outside of work I enjoy being outdoors, reading or writing, playing games, and making music.

If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you on [Farcaster](https://farcaster.xyz/theref.eth).
