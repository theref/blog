Hey — I’m James.

I build and explain decentralised systems for a living, and I use writing to think in public. This site is my “home base”: a place for work that’s too technical for a tweet, too opinionated for a doc, and too useful to leave trapped in DMs.

I’m a web3 developer-turned-DevRel/product person. Most of my day job lives at the intersection of **cryptography, developer experience, governance, and shipping things that actually work** — not just things that look good in a deck.

If you’re here because we met through a talk, a repo, a governance thread, or a long conversation about why most coordination mechanisms behave like wet cardboard under pressure: welcome. You’re in the right place.

## What I’m trying to do

I’m obsessed with a simple question:

**How do we help people and communities become less dependent on centralised authorities — without replacing them with new, worse authorities?**

In practice, that turns into a handful of recurring themes:

- **Threshold cryptography, key management, and “programmable trust”** (what it enables, where it breaks, how to design around humans)
- **Governance that doesn’t collapse under incentives** (token voting, delegation, legitimacy, power, coordination failure modes)
- **Privacy as a default setting** (not a feature you bolt on when you feel guilty)
- **Product and UX for real users** (not just protocol enjoyers)
- **High-agency building** (how to move from ideas → prototypes → adoption without waiting for permission)

I’m not interested in ideology as performance. I *am* interested in tools, incentives, and institutions — and how they shape what people can actually do.

## What you’ll find here

This blog is a mix of:

**1) Field notes from building**  
Post-mortems, architecture sketches, and lessons learned while shipping. Expect diagrams, trade-offs, and occasional “well, that was a mistake” honesty.

**2) Governance & coordination essays**  
Longer-form thinking on what works, what fails, and why. Less “hot take”, more “here’s the model, here are the incentives, here’s what I’d try next.”

**3) Talks, workshops, and resources**  
Links to slides, recordings, demos, and the distilled version of whatever I’ve been ranting about on stage.

**4) A little personal signal**  
Not diary content — just enough context to understand the lens I’m looking through: the books shaping me, the projects I’m exploring, the habits that keep me sane, and the creative stuff I’m learning alongside the technical work.

Tone-wise: I like clarity, I try to be fair, and I’m allergic to buzzword soup. I also have a soft spot for dry humour and the occasional metaphor that gets slightly out of hand.

## Who this is for

If you’re:
- building in web3 and want deeper technical/product thinking,
- navigating governance or community coordination,
- interested in privacy, decentralisation, and real-world adoption,
- or you just like careful writing about messy systems…

…then you’ll probably get value here.

If you’re looking for “number go up” content, daily price commentary, or maximalist tribalism: you’ll be bored (which is a win for both of us).

## A few quick facts, to make me legible

- I work in the **developer/product** orbit: prototyping, docs, integrations, and translating between engineers and humans.
- I care a lot about **property rights and autonomy** as foundations for functional societies — and I’m interested in what happens when those foundations erode.
- Outside of work I’m usually making something: writing, learning to draw, or messing with music (often in ways that are more satisfying than polished).

If you’re building something interesting in privacy, governance, or decentralised coordination, I’m always up for a good conversation — especially if it comes with concrete problems and sharp questions.
